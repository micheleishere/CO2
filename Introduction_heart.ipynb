    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "This data set came from the University of California Irvine data repository and is used to predict heart disease\n",
    "SUMMARY\n",
    "This is a data set used to predict heart disease. Patients were classified as having or not having heart disease based on cardiac catheterization, the gold standard. If they had more than 50% narrowing of a coronary artery they were labeled as having heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cohort, there are 270 patients and there are 13 independent predictive variables or column attributes. The attributes are explained on the website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease\n",

    "\n",
    "After this dataset became available, the UCI data repository made another cohort available with 303 patients. They shared this with Kaggle which is a data competition initiative. First, the file format is .data which is uncommonly used. Secondly, the outcome was reversed by accident. This is why we are still using the older cohort of patients\n",

    "2. Individual Classification Algorithms\n",
    "The study initially applied six supervised learning algorithms to establish a baseline for prediction accuracy:\n",
    "• Bayes Net and Naïve Bayes: Probability-based models that use acyclic directed graphs and conditional independence to predict class labels.\n",
    "• Random Forest: A tree-based ensemble algorithm that creates multiple decision trees and makes a final decision via majority voting.\n",
    "• C4.5: A decision tree algorithm that uses the \"information gain ratio\" to split data into univariate trees.\n",
    "• Multilayer Perceptron: An artificial neural network model that uses layers of perceptrons and activation functions to map weighted inputs.\n",
    "• PART: A rule-based algorithm that acts as an advanced version of C4.5 and RIPPER.\n",

    "The final project explores the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms for the prediction and diagnosis of heart disease. As heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, this project, we aim to understand, how early detection strategies can be improved using these tools, which have the potential to enhance patient outcomes and reduce disease-related mortality (Alshenawy, 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying biological mechanisms of heart attacks and strokes involve obstruction of blood flow to the heart or brain due to arterial plaque accumulation or thrombus formation. A major clinical challenge is that symptoms of heart disease are often nonspecific, overlapping with those of other conditions or being misattributed to normal aging, which complicates preventive and accurate diagnosis (Quah et al., 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning has become an increasingly important tool in healthcare, enhancing clinical decision-making in disease prediction and diagnosis. Traditional approaches relied largely on practitioners’ interpretation of a patient’s medical history, reported symptoms, and physical examination findings (Karthick et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository and is widely employed for heart disease prediction tasks. Patient outcomes were determined using cardiac catheterization, considered the clinical gold standard, where individuals exhibiting more than 50% narrowing of a coronary artery were classified as having heart disease.\n",
    "The dataset comprises 270 patient records and includes 13 independent predictive variables. Detailed descriptions of these attributes are provided in the UCI repository documentation (University of California, Irvine, n.d.)\n",
    "\n",
    "An updated version of the heart disease dataset includes 303 consecutive patients referred for coronary angiography at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, between May 1981 and September 1984. This cohort was used to develop the Cleveland algorithm, a computerized diagnostic model whose regression coefficients were later validated using independent patient populations from Budapest, Long Beach, and Switzerland.\n",
    "The Cleveland cohort had a mean age of 54 years, consisted of 68% men, and showed a disease prevalence of 46%. The model was derived from 13 clinical and test-related variables, with age, sex, chest pain type, and systolic blood pressure identified as key predictors. Chest pain was categorized as typical anginal, atypical anginal, nonanginal, or asymptomatic, and inclusion of age, sex, and chest pain type was required for clinically relevant disease probability estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because complete joint distributions of clinical variables were rarely available, the original model assumed independence among predictors. However, previous research has shown that ignoring interdependencies between symptoms can result in overconfident predictions and inaccurate disease probability estimates (Detrano et al., 1989). \n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the overconfidence that can arise from assuming independence among clinical variables, the study of Kathleen employs an ensemble learning approach using the Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. AdaBoost is a meta-learning method that combines multiple weak classifiers into a single, more robust predictive model. Through 100 iterative boosting rounds, the algorithm adaptively increases the weight of observations that were misclassified in previous iterations, encouraging subsequent classifiers to focus on complex or interacting symptom patterns that are difficult to capture with a single model. The final prediction is produced via a weighted majority vote of all component classifiers, resulting in a classifier that is less prone to overconfident assumptions and better aligned with the true diagnostic outcome (Kathleen et al., 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alshenawy (2024) evaluated several machine learning algorithms, both individually and in ensemble settings, to identify reliable approaches for heart disease diagnosis. The models analyzed included Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression as a baseline. The data were divided into training (189 observations) and testing (81 observations) sets, and model performance was assessed using multiple metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the individual models, Random Forest achieved the highest overall performance, while ensemble approaches using bagging produced comparable but not superior results. Building on this framework, the data challenge project work CO2 applies a similar comparative evaluation of multiple machine learning models, with particular emphasis on ensemble methods, to assess their effectiveness in heart disease prediction.\n"
