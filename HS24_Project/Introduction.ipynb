    "## An introduction in the semester project of CO2 Machine Learning and Pattern Recognision\n",

    "The prediction of accident locations and their severity is a relevant and practical challenge that can be addressed using machine learning methods. In view of the constant urbanisation and the increase in road traffic, the identification of potential accident hotspots in urban areas is of considerable importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, the dataset ‘Police-registered traffic accidents in the city of Zurich since 2011’ is used, which provides detailed information on road traffic accidents in Zurich. This dataset contains attributes such as the accident location, the time of the accident (year, month, day of the week, hour), the road type, the accident type, the accident involvement, the accident severity category and more. The focus here is on relevant features such as RoadType, Accident Month, Weekday and Time, as well as the type of paries involved in the accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, our group wanted to develop a prediction model that identifies accident black spots spatially and temporally. However, after the first data analyses, it turned out that the necessary correlation of the data for solving the mentioned problem is not given. However, more on this in the discussion of the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we decided to shift the focus to the severity of the incidents. Such models not only have the potential to contribute to accident prevention, but also to recognise critical locations and time periods in cities at an early stage. This means that measures such as targeted budgeting for infrastructure improvements or the preventive planning of resources by the police and emergency services can be organised more effectively. In addition, driving schools and preventive education programmes can highlight specific danger spots and thus further improve road safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "As early as 2005, a study was carried out using machine learning to develop a model that could predict the severity of injuries in road accidents. Factors such as driver characteristics, road conditions and environmental factors were taken into account.\n",
    "A model was successfully implemented. Using a hybrid method consisting of decision trees and neural networks, a high level of accuracy was achieved, especially for injury classes such as ‘serious’ and ‘fatal’(Chong, Abraham & Paprzycki, 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a study conducted by the ZHAW, a standardised method was developed to evaluate the development of accident figures over time and to analyse the effectiveness of road safety measures. Among other things, accident trends, statistical significance and their effects were analysed.Statistical models based on negative binomial regression were successfully implemented. With the help of an early warning system and an impact analysis, a precise assessment of accident trends and the effectiveness of measures was achieved, which significantly supported road safety work. However, no machine learning was used; the focus was exclusively on classic statistical approaches (ZHAW, n.d.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In April last year (2024), a study was published that developed a model for predicting the severity of injuries in road accidents. Using machine learning and transfer learning techniques, in particular the MobileNet model, an exceptionally high accuracy of 98.17% was achieved. The SHAP technique also made it possible to transparently analyse the most important influencing factors, such as road categories, weather conditions and drug use.\n",
    "The study provides valuable insights for the improvement of accident prevention strategies and lays a foundation for future research in the field of road safety (Aboulola, 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for innovative approaches to traffic accident analysis is great, as further studies show. Sharma and Usha (2023) investigated the effectiveness of algorithms such as Random Forest and SVM, while Behboudi et al. (2024) analysed 191 studies on accident prediction in a comprehensive review. Hemalatha and Dhuwaraganath (2024) focused on the prediction of accidents taking into account factors such as road conditions and weather. This work illustrates the potential of modern technologies for road safety research.\n",
    "\n",
    "By developing a model based on the selected dataset and using the methods discussed in the course, this project will not only contribute to the practical application of machine learning methods, but also create a basis for further research and applications in the field of urban traffic planning."
